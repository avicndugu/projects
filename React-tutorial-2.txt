I decided to have another go at React after testing a little bit on Vue.

I had a selection of tutorials to follow along.
I settled on two:
Tania Rascia's tutorial
React's official Tic-tac-toe tutorial 


11:55- 12:12
Installed a new project here.
    npx create-react-app react-tutorial-2
    cd react-tutorial-2
    yarn start

You can now view react-tutorial-2 in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000

React: used to build user interfaces UI's
Build complex UI's by building small parts called components.

There are different kind of components
1. React.Component subclasses

    class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div className="shopping-list">
            <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Instagram</li>
              <li>WhatsApp</li>
              <li>Oculus</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

    // Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />

Components tell react what it should show on screen/ display.
A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.( I have no Idea what this means at this particular time).

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result.

Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components.

Delete files inside src by:
rm -f *
touch index.js index.css


Added git ignore for node modules
made a first commit.
